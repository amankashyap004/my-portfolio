            Hi there! My name is Aman Kashyap, and I am a passionate front-end web developer. I
            specialize in building user-friendly and responsive interfaces using HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and React. I have honed my skills in creating visually stunning websites
            that provide an excellent user experience. My goal as a developer is to create engaging
            and interactive digital experiences that captivate audiences and make a positive impact
            on their lives. I'm excited to continue my journey in web development and explore new
            possibilities in this dynamic and ever-evolving field.
